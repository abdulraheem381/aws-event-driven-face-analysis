# ðŸŽ¯ Event-Driven Facial Analysis with AWS Rekognition

This project is a serverless application that automatically analyzes user-submitted selfies/images using Amazon Rekognition. Results are saved to DynamoDB for further use.

---

## ðŸ“¸ How It Works

1. User uploads an image to an S3 bucket (`image-rekognition-3434234234`)
2. S3 triggers a Lambda function
3. Lambda uses **Amazon Rekognition** to detect:
   - Emotions
   - Age range
   - Gender
   - Facial features
4. Result is stored in a **DynamoDB** table (`user-images`)
